# Comparative Wordlist Elicitation Tool (Android)

This repository contains the source code for an Android application designed to assist linguists and fieldworkers in the systematic **elicitation and documentation of minority languages**.

The tool facilitates the collection of:

- **Phonetic Transcriptions:** Input fields for documenting words using IPA or other relevant orthographies.

- **Audio Recordings:** Functionality to capture high-quality audio recordings associated with each word.

- **Media Display:** Ability to display relevant pictures or media (when available in the wordlist data) to aid the elicitation process.

## Licensing (AGPL-3.0)

The source code for the Comparative Wordlist Elicitation Tool is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPL-3.0)**.

The full license text is available in the `LICENSE.md` file in this repository.

### AGPL-3.0 Obligations

The AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license designed for networked software. If you **modify** this application's source code and **distribute** or **make the modified version available to users over a computer network** (e.g., hosting it on a public server or distributing a modified app), you must make the **complete corresponding source code** of your modifications available to those users.

## Wordlist Data Requirement (Crucial License Separation)

**This application's code is licensed AGPL-3.0. The wordlist data it uses is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.**

To maintain legal clarity and separation: **This application does NOT bundle any wordlist data.** Users must acquire and import a wordlist file separately.

We recommend using the officially adapted data file available from our dedicated data repository:

### 1. Acquire the Data File

The **Quickstart Worldlist of Melanesia** data is available under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**.

Please download the standardized XML file (e.g., `QWOM2025-08.xml`) from the data repository:

> **Data Repository Link:** **https://github.com/rulingAnts/QWOM_Data**

### 2. Import Instructions

1. Transfer the acquired XML wordlist file to your Android device.

2. Launch the Comparative Wordlist Elicitation Tool.

3. Navigate to the "Import Wordlist" function and load the XML file.

By using this method, the AGPL-licensed software acts merely as a tool operating on the user-acquired, CC BY-NC-SA licensed data, ensuring no license conflict arises.
